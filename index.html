            <h1>Introduction to the application.</h1>
            <p>PowerShell (including Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core) is a task automation and configuration
                management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting
                language built on the .NET Framework. Initially a Windows component only, PowerShell was made
                open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016.</p>

            <p>In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which
                are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. Sets of cmdlets may be combined into
                scripts, executables (which are standalone applications), or by instantiating regular .NET classes (or
                WMI/COM Objects). These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the file system or
                registry, which are made available to the PowerShell runtime via PowerShell providers.</p>

            <p>PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks
                on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote
                Linux systems and network devices. PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the PowerShell
                runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications can then use PowerShell
                functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface.
                This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality
                as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts
                which invoke the necessary cmdlets. Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008
                also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets.</p>

            <p>PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help (similar to man pages in Unix shells)
                accessible via the Get-Help cmdlet. Local help contents can be retrieved from the Internet via
                Update-Help cmdlet. Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired on a case-by-case basis via the
                -online switch to Get-Help.</p>
