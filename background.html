            <h1>Brief background</h1>
            <p>Every released version of Microsoft DOS and Microsoft Windows for personal computers has included a
                command-line interface tool (shell). These are COMMAND.COM (in installations relying on MS-DOS,
                including Windows 9x) and cmd.exe (in Windows NT family of operating systems). The shell is a command
                line interpreter that supports a few basic commands. For other purposes, a separate console application
                must be invoked from the shell. The shell also includes a scripting language (batch files), which can
                be used to automate various tasks. However, the shell cannot be used to automate all facets of GUI
                functionality, in part because command-line equivalents of operations exposed via the graphical
                interface are limited, and the scripting language is elementary and does not allow the creation of
                complex scripts. In Windows Server 2003, the situation was improved, but scripting support was still
                considered unsatisfactory.</p>

            <p>Microsoft attempted to address some of these shortcomings by introducing the Windows Script Host in 1998
                with Windows 98, and its command-line based host: cscript.exe. It integrates with the Active Script
                engine and allows scripts to be written in compatible languages, such as JScript and VBScript,
                leveraging the APIs exposed by applications via COM. However, it has its own deficiencies: it is not
                integrated with the shell, its documentation is not very accessible, and it quickly gained a reputation
                as a system vulnerability vector after several high-profile computer viruses exploited weaknesses in
                its security provisions. Different versions of Windows provided various special-purpose command line
                interpreters (such as netsh and WMIC) with their own command sets. None of them were integrated with
                the command shell; nor were they interoperable.</p>

            <p>By 2002 Microsoft had started to develop a new approach to command line management, including a shell
                called Monad (also known as Microsoft Shell or MSH). The shell and the ideas behind it were published
                in August 2002 in a white paper titled Monad Manifesto.[9] Monad was to be a new extensible command
                shell with a fresh design that would be capable of automating a full range of core administrative
                tasks. Microsoft first showed off Monad at the Professional Development Conference in Los Angeles in
                October 2003. A private beta program began a few months later which eventually led to a public beta
                program.</p>

            <p>Microsoft published the first Monad public beta release on June 17, 2005, Beta 2 on September 11, 2005,
                and Beta 3 on January 10, 2006. Not much later, on April 25, 2006 Microsoft formally announced that
                Monad had been renamed Windows PowerShell, positioning it as a significant part of their management
                technology offerings. Release Candidate 1 of PowerShell was released at the same time. A significant
                aspect of both the name change and the RC was that this was now a component of Windows, and not an
                add-on product.</p>

            <p>Release Candidate 2 of PowerShell version 1 was released on September 26, 2006 with final Release to the
                web (RTW) on November 14, 2006 and announced at TechEd Barcelona. PowerShell for earlier versions of
                Windows was released on January 30, 2007.</p>

            <p>PowerShell v2.0 development began before PowerShell v1.0 shipped. During the development, Microsoft
                shipped three community technology preview (CTP). Microsoft made these releases available to the
                public. The last CTP release of Windows PowerShell v2.0 was made available in December 2008.</p>

            <p>PowerShell v2.0 was completed and released to manufacturing in August 2009, as an integral part of
                Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Versions of PowerShell for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
                Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 were released in October 2009 and are available for download for
                both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 shipped a testing framework for PowerShell.</p>

            <p>On 18 August 2016, Microsoft announced[14] that they had made PowerShell open-source and cross-platform
                with support for Windows, OS X, CentOS and Ubuntu. The source code was published on GitHub. The move to
                open source created a second incarnation of PowerShell called "PowerShell Core", which runs on .NET
                Core. It is distinct from "Windows PowerShell", which runs on the full .NET Framework. Starting with
                version 5.1, PowerShell Core is bundled with Windows Server 2016 Nano Server.</p>
