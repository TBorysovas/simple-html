            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>PowerShell's developers based the core grammar of the tool on that of POSIX 1003.2.</p>

            <p>Windows PowerShell can execute four kinds of named commands:</p>

            <ul id="desList">
                <li>cmdlets (.NET Framework programs designed to interact with PowerShell)</li>
                <li>PowerShell scripts (files suffixed by <span class="words">.ps1</span>)</li>
                <li>PowerShell functions</li>
                <li>standalone executable programs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If a command is a standalone executable program, <span class="words">PowerShell.exe</span> launches it
                in a separate process; if it is a cmdlet, it executes in the PowerShell process. PowerShell provides an
                interactive command-line interface, wherein the commands can be entered and their output displayed. The
                user interface, based on the Win32 console, offers customizable tab completion. PowerShell enables the
                creation of aliases for cmdlets, which PowerShell textually translates into invocations of the original
                commands. PowerShell supports both named and positional parameters for commands. In executing a cmdlet,
                the job of binding the argument value to the parameter is done by PowerShell itself, but for external
                executables, arguments are parsed by the external executable independently of PowerShell
                interpretation.</p>

            <p>The PowerShell Extended Type System (ETS) is based on the .NET type system, but with extended semantics
                (for example, propertySets and third-party extensibility). For example, it enables the creation of
                different views of objects by exposing only a subset of the data fields, properties, and methods, as
                well as specifying custom formatting and sorting behavior. These views are mapped to the original
                object using XML-based configuration files.</p>

            <h3>Cmdlets</h3>
            <p>Cmdlets are specialized commands in the PowerShell environment that implement specific functions. These
                are the native commands in the PowerShell stack. Cmdlets follow a Verb-Noun naming pattern, such as
                Get-ChildItem, helping to make them self-descriptive. Cmdlets output their results as objects or as
                collections thereof (including arrays), and can optionally receive input in that form, making them
                suitable for use as recipients in a pipeline. But whereas PowerShell allows arrays and other
                collections of objects to be written to the pipeline, cmdlets always process objects individually. For
                collections of objects, PowerShell invokes the cmdlet on each object in the collection, in sequence.</p>

            <p>Cmdlets are specialized .NET classes, which the PowerShell runtime instantiates and invokes at run-time.
                Cmdlets derive either from Cmdlet or from PSCmdlet, the latter being used when the cmdlet needs to
                interact with the PowerShell runtime. These base classes specify certain methods – BeginProcessing(),
                ProcessRecord() and EndProcessing() – which the cmdlet's implementation overrides to provide the
                functionality. Whenever a cmdlet runs, PowerShell invokes these methods in sequence, with
                ProcessRecord() being called if it receives pipeline input. If a collection of objects is piped, the
                method is invoked for each object in the collection. The class implementing the Cmdlet must have one
                .NET attribute – CmdletAttribute – which specifies the verb and the noun that make up the name of the
                cmdlet. Common verbs are provided as an enum.</p>

            <p>If a cmdlet receives either pipeline input or command-line parameter input, there must be a
                corresponding property in the class, with a mutator implementation. PowerShell invokes the mutator with
                the parameter value or pipeline input, which is saved by the mutator implementation in class variables.
                These values are then referred to by the methods which implement the functionality. Properties that map
                to command-line parameters are marked by ParameterAttribute and are set before the call to
                BeginProcessing(). Those which map to pipeline input are also flanked by ParameterAttribute, but with
                the ValueFromPipeline attribute parameter set.</p>

            <p>The implementation of these cmdlet classes can refer to any .NET API and may be in any .NET language. In
                addition, PowerShell makes certain APIs available, such as WriteObject(), which is used to access
                PowerShell-specific functionality, such as writing resultant objects to the pipeline. Cmdlets can use
                .NET data access APIs directly or use the PowerShell infrastructure of PowerShell Providers, which make
                data stores addressable using unique paths. Data stores are exposed using drive letters, and
                hierarchies within them, addressed as directories. Windows PowerShell ships with providers for the file
                system, registry, the certificate store, as well as the namespaces for command aliases, variables, and
                functions. Windows PowerShell also includes various cmdlets for managing various Windows systems,
                including the file system, or using Windows Management Instrumentation to control Windows components.
                Other applications can register cmdlets with PowerShell, thus allowing it to manage them, and, if they
                enclose any datastore (such as databases), they can add specific providers as well.</p>

            <p>PowerShell V2 added a more portable version of Cmdlets called Modules. The PowerShell V2 release notes
                state:</p>

            <p id="citation"><i>"Modules allow script developers and administrators to partition and organize their
                    Windows PowerShell code in self-contained, reusable units. Code from a module executes in its own
                    self-contained context and does not affect the state outside of the module. Modules also enable you
                    to define a restricted runspace environment by using a script."</i></p>

            <h3>Pipeline</h3>
            <p>PowerShell implements the concept of a pipeline, which enables piping the output of one cmdlet to
                another cmdlet as input. For example, the output of the Get-Process cmdlet could be piped to the
                Where-Object to filter any process that has less than 1 MB of paged memory, and then to the Sort-Object
                cmdlet (e.g., to sort the objects by handle count), and then finally to the Select-Object cmdlet to
                select just the first 10 (i.e., the 10 processes based on handle count).</p>

            <p>As with Unix pipelines, PowerShell pipelines can construct complex commands, using the <span class="words">|</span>
                operator to connect stages. However, the PowerShell pipeline differs from Unix pipelines in that stages
                execute within the PowerShell runtime rather than as a set of processes coordinated by the operating
                system, and structured .NET objects, rather than byte streams, are passed from one stage to the next.
                Using objects and executing stages within the PowerShell runtime eliminates the need to serialize data
                structures, or to extract them by explicitly parsing text output. An object can also encapsulate
                certain functions that work on the contained data, which become available to the recipient command for
                use. For the last cmdlet in a pipeline, PowerShell automatically pipes its output object to the
                Out-Default cmdlet, which transforms the objects into a stream of format objects and then renders those
                to the screen.</p>

            <p>Because all PowerShell objects are .NET objects, they share a <span class="words">.ToString()</span>
                method, which retrieves the text representation of the data in an object. In addition, PowerShell
                allows formatting definitions to be specified, so the text representation of objects can be customized
                by choosing which data elements to display, and in what manner. However, in order to maintain backwards
                compatibility, if an external executable is used in a pipeline, it receives a text stream representing
                the object, instead of directly integrating with the PowerShell type system.</p>

            <h3>Scripting</h3>
            <p>Windows PowerShell includes a dynamically typed scripting language which can implement complex
                operations using cmdlets imperatively. The scripting language supports variables, functions, branching
                (if-then-else), loops (while, do, for, and foreach), structured error/exception handling and
                closures/lambda expressions, as well as integration with .NET. Variables in PowerShell scripts are
                prefixed with $. Variables can be assigned any value, including the output of cmdlets. Strings can be
                enclosed either in single quotes or in double quotes: when using double quotes, variables will be
                expanded even if they are inside the quotation marks. Enclosing the path to a file in braces preceded
                by a dollar sign (as in <span class="words">${C:\foo.txt}</span>) creates a reference to the contents
                of the file. If it is used as an L-value, anything assigned to it will be written to the file. When
                used as an R-value, the contents of the file will be read. If an object is assigned, it is serialized
                before being stored.</p>

            <p>Object members can be accessed using <span class="words">.</span> notation, as in C# syntax. PowerShell
                provides special variables, such as <span class="words">$args</span>, which is an array of all the
                command line arguments passed to a function from the command line, and <span class="words">$_</span>,
                which refers to the current object in the pipeline. PowerShell also provides arrays and associative
                arrays. The PowerShell scripting language also evaluates arithmetic expressions entered on the command
                line immediately, and it parses common abbreviations, such as GB, MB, and KB.</p>

            <p>Using the function keyword, PowerShell provides for the creation of functions, the following general
                form:</p>

            <pre>
                    <code>
                        <div id="designFunc">
function name ($Param1, $Param2) {
    Instructions
    }
                        </div>
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <p>The defined function is invoked in either of the following forms:</p>

            <ul id="desListForm">
                <li>name value1 value2</li>
                <li>name -Param1 value1 -Param2 value2</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PowerShell supports named parameters, positional parameters, switch parameters and dynamic parameters.</p>

            <p>PowerShell allows any .NET methods to be called by providing their namespaces enclosed in brackets ([]),
                and then using a pair of colons (::) to indicate the static method. For example,
                [System.Console]::WriteLine("PowerShell"). Objects are created using the New-Object cmdlet. Calling
                methods of .NET objects is accomplished by using the regular.</p>

            <p>PowerShell scripting language accepts strings, both raw and escaped. A string enclosed between single
                quotation marks is a raw string while a string enclosed between double quotation marks is an escaped
                string. PowerShell treats straight and curly quotes as equivalent.</p>

            <p>For error handling, PowerShell provides a .NET-based exception-handling mechanism. In case of errors,
                objects containing information about the error (Exception object) are thrown, which are caught using
                the try ... catch construct (although a trap construct is supported as well). However, the
                action-or-error is configurable; in case of an error, PowerShell can be configured to silently resume
                execution, without actually throwing the exception.</p>

            <p>Scripts written using PowerShell can be made to persist across sessions in either a <span class="words">.ps1</span>
                file or a <span class="words">.psm1</span> file (the latter is used to implement a module). Later,
                either the entire script or individual functions in the script can be used. Scripts and functions
                operate analogously with cmdlets, in that they can be used as commands in pipelines, and parameters can
                be bound to them. Pipeline objects can be passed between functions, scripts, and cmdlets seamlessly. To
                prevent unintentional running of scripts, script execution is disabled by default and must be enabled
                explicitly.[45] Enabling of scripts can be performed either at system, user or session level.
                PowerShell scripts can be signed to verify their integrity, and are subject to Code Access Security.</p>

            <p>The PowerShell scripting language supports binary prefix notation similar to the scientific notation
                supported by many programming languages in the C-family.</p>

            <h3>Hosting</h3>
            <p>One can also use PowerShell embedded in a management application, which uses the PowerShell runtime to
                implement the management functionality. For this, PowerShell provides a managed hosting API. Via the
                APIs, the application can instantiate a runspace (one instantiation of the PowerShell runtime), which
                runs in the application's process and is exposed as a Runspace object. The state of the runspace is
                encased in a SessionState object. When the runspace is created, the Windows PowerShell runtime
                initializes the instantiation, including initializing the providers and enumerating the cmdlets, and
                updates the SessionState object accordingly. The Runspace then must be opened for either synchronous
                processing or asynchronous processing. After that it can be used to execute commands.</p>

            <p>To execute a command, a pipeline (represented by a Pipeline object) must be created and associated with
                the runspace. The pipeline object is then populated with the cmdlets that make up the pipeline. For
                sequential operations (as in a PowerShell script), a Pipeline object is created for each statement and
                nested inside another Pipeline object. When a pipeline is created, Windows PowerShell invokes the
                pipeline processor, which resolves the cmdlets into their respective assemblies (the command processor)
                and adds a reference to them to the pipeline, and associates them with InputPipe, Outputpipe and
                ErrorOutputPipe objects, to represent the connection with the pipeline. The types are verified and
                parameters bound using reflection. Once the pipeline is set up, the host calls the Invoke() method to
                run the commands, or its asynchronous equivalent – InvokeAsync(). If the pipeline has the Write-Host
                cmdlet at the end of the pipeline, it writes the result onto the console screen. If not, the results
                are handed over to the host, which might either apply further processing or display the output itself.</p>

            <p>Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 uses the hosting APIs to provide its management GUI. Each operation
                exposed in the GUI is mapped to a sequence of PowerShell commands (or pipelines). The host creates the
                pipeline and executes them. In fact, the interactive PowerShell console itself is a PowerShell host,
                which interprets the scripts entered at command line and creates the necessary Pipeline objects and
                invokes them</p>
